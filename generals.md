# General Exam Lists

<hr/>

In the hopes that some future grad student can make use of these, I’ve posted the working versions of my PhD general exam lists, compiled in 2009.  Strikethroughs indicate texts that ultimately weren’t covered on the final exam.  Click through, or you can download the pdfs.

Major Field I: [20th Century American Fiction](http://wythoff.net/generals_americanfiction) [or download the [pdf](http://wythoff.net/pdf/generals_americanfiction.pdf)]

- Subfield: [American Film from the Cinema of Attractions to Classical Hollywood](http://wythoff.net/generals_americanfilm)

Major Field II: [Media Theory](http://wythoff.net/generals_mediatheory) [or download the [pdf](http://wythoff.net/pdf/generals_mediatheory.pdf)]
