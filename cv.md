<p>Introduction to Digital Media, Columbia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An undergraduate lecture course introducing students to the history and theory of digital media.

Each of these concepts are explored in readings and through hands-on lab activities.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Science of Fiction: American Naturalism, 1880-1915, Columbia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An advanced undergraduate seminar exploring how naturalist literature imagined itself as a form of data collection.

</blockquote>

<p>An advanced undergraduate seminar on the history of reading practices. With today’s dramatic movement of readers from page to screen, do we accept that a change in format can affect the ways we read? How do technologies of literacy – scrolling, bookmarking, page, index, tab, bookshelf – become metaphors in the digital age? Seminar coupled with a lab component for experiments in digital textuality.</p>
