					I am a writer and researcher at the <a href="https://cdh.princeton.edu/">Center for Digital Humanities</a> at Princeton University. My first book — <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-perversity-of-things"><i>The Perversity of Things: Hugo Gernsback on Media, Tinkering, and Scientifiction</i></a> — explores how science fiction began among the maker movement of the 1910s. It was published in the University of Minnesota Press’s Electronic Mediations series and was a pilot project for the Manifold Scholarship interactive book platform.
