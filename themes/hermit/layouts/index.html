I am a writer and researcher at the <a href="https://cdh.princeton.edu/">Center for Digital Humanities</a> at Princeton University. My first book — <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-perversity-of-things"><i>The Perversity of Things: Hugo Gernsback on Media, Tinkering, and Scientifiction</i></a> — explores how science fiction began among the maker movement of the 1910s. It was published in the University of Minnesota Press’s Electronic Mediations series and was a pilot project for the Manifold Scholarship interactive book platform.
<br>
Before coming to Princeton, I held postdoctoral fellowships with the Columbia University Society of Fellows in the Humanities and the Penn State Center for Humanities and Information. At Columbia, I was a co-founder of the <a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/">Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities</a>, a collective dedicated to process-based scholarship and the rapid prototyping of speculative ideas. At Penn State, I developed a workshop series on “Data Privacy, Democracy, and the Humanities.”
<br>
I have written about wireless telegraphy, boredom, technocratic politics, the history of method in the humanities, television, archaeology, and the philosophy of technique. This work has appeared in <i>Digital Humanities Quarterly, Grey Room, The Washington Post, Configurations, Amodern, The Programming Historian,</i> and <i>Real Life Magazine.</i> My teaching includes courses on American naturalism, social media and the novel, global science fiction, digital culture, and what happens when readers move from page to screen. <i class="fa-github"></i>
