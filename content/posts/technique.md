Ideas are products of our environments. It’s no accident that when a new paradigm of media studies appeared on the scene going by the name of “media archaeology,” we were in the process of turning on our first smartphones and gawking at our friends’ new tablets. Media archaeology gave us a set of historical lenses through which, if only indirectly, we could understand those strange gadgets in terms of what came before. A decade later, digital devices are an embedded part of our daily lives. Far clearer are the changes they have introduced to our relationships, our politics, and our sense of the world around us. Perhaps for this reason, scholars are increasingly adopting approaches to the use of media technology, from philosophies of technique, habit, and know-how, to histories of neglected ideas like psychotechnics, the useful arts, and the chaîne opératoire. Recent scholarship along these lines includes studies of philosophies of technology written by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century engineers and mechanics, the growing translation and influence of work on cultural techniques [Kulturtechniken], and an ongoing Historical Dictionary of Media-in-Use [Historisches Wörterbuch des Mediengebrauchs].

This issue of Amodern will profile how media studies scholars of all kinds are extending the object-orientation of media archaeology. What are some of the emerging approaches to the sensuousness, intimacy, virtuosity, and fetishism that characterizes the relationship between users and their devices? What do the terms technics / technique / technê / technology mean in a work of media scholarship today? Methodological reflections are also welcome: at what point in your research did you begin reaching out for new points of reference? How do scholars who are trained in the analysis of texts and artifacts approach questions of technique? Are ethnographic methods necessary?

And so technique was the focus of the Toulouse gathering in part by linguistic necessity, in part by historical circumstance. For years, the Annales circle had been discussing the need for a new approach, method, or discipline devoted to technique. Mauss wrote in 1927 that “we have never had the time and strength necessary to give technical phenomena the formidable place they deserve.”[1] Bloch argued in 1932 that “nothing would matter more to the progress of our historical research than good work on the evolution of various techniques.”[2] Febvre introduced a 1935 issue of Annales devoted to the subject.[3] And Meyerson opened the Toulouse gathering in 1941 by arguing that older fields devoted to the applied study of technique (physiology, scientific management, psychotechnics[4]) needed to be replaced by new historical approaches capable of exploring technique “from its first artisanal and rural forms to contemporary machinery.”[5] The conference was the culmination of these long-running discussions.

Mauss and Bloch each had their own reasons for positioning technique as one of the most pressing concerns for their disciplines of sociology and history, respectively. But their approaches to the concept were not only the product of academic debates. Ideas are embodied things, especially when it comes to ideas about technique. Mauss first turned to the subject while running a cooperative bakery he founded with friends, La Boulangerie, in the belief that socialism expressed itself best through practice.[6] (Uncle Émile, who had urged Marcel to take his hands out of the dough and focus on his studies, was not pleased when the bakery went bankrupt in 1901.[7]) Serving in the Army during World War I gave Mauss a very different perspective on technique when he noticed that English troops “did not know how to use French spades” or march to the rhythm of a French bugler. An ethnographic mind even during war, Mauss obsearved that “a manual knack can only be learnt slowly. Every technique properly so-called has its own form.”[8] Bloch left the trenches fascinated with the collective mentality of his company and the unreliability of his own memories of war, which seemed to him like “a discontinuous series of images, vivid in themselves, but badly arranged, like a reel of motion picture film containing some large gaps and some reversals of certain scenes.”[9] The daily procedures of warfare and the way they were so poorly remembered after the fact left Bloch with an understanding of history as a chaotic accumulation of individual psychologies, routines, and beliefs. The 1941 gathering in Toulouse was the occasion for revisiting these pressing and intensely personal assumptions.

Only Bertrand Gille and Maurice Daumas, peripheral to historiography in France, took up this charge until the 1980s, when social scientists began collaborating with historians of technology in the beginnings of what would become STS.

Durkheim wrote to his nephew offering him a loan to keep the venture afloat, and concluded the letter with: “Je t'en prie, prends conscience de la faute que tu as commise. Dis-moi que tu n'as pas vu les choses sous leur aspect véritable. Cela m'apportera du moins quelque espoir.”
