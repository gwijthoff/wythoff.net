## [*Gadgetry: A History of Techniques*](http://gadgetry.wythoff.net/)

Across the twentieth century, many kinds of objects were described as gadgets, from dashboard gauges to atomic bombs, can-openers to smartphones. While "gadget" can be a placeholder for any kind of object, even imaginary ones, I argue that its evolving application to particular tools and techniques reveals important lessons about our relationship to technology. The gadget is a unique genre, comprising physical objects, conceptions, and habits.

In this book, I draw on my background in literary studies to address some of the most pressing debates in digital culture today by analyzing as a form of fiction the user's imagination of how their gadgets work. For example, a single iPhone contains over half the elements of the periodic table, extracted from almost every continent on the planet and compressed into a thin slab that allows the user to dip her toes into a river of collective affect generated by the social network of everyone she's ever met. This is a fantastically science-fictional experience that is now part of our everyday lives. But the emergence of new digital cultures, political movements, and forms of intimacy are all predicated on the unique habits each user adopts in order to understand these complex gadgets.

*Gadgetry* goes beyond the nuts and bolts of a given piece of technology in order to explore the distinctly vernacular philosophies--the media theories from below--that emerge from users and their everyday practices.
