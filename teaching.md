## [Global Science Fiction](https://gwijthoff.github.io/globalSF/)

Spring 2018 • undergrad lecture • Penn State

> This class will introduce students to the history of science fiction, as well as the poetics that distinguish the genre as a unique form of literary production. Our focus will be international, surveying the global production of speculative narratives in several languages (all translated into English). Each of the novels––and some comics––we will read represent a pivotal moment in the development of the genre:  from nineteenth-century utopian precursors, to pulp origins, to the postwar Golden Age, and then from New Wave explorations of race, gender, and sexuality all the way up to the contemporary drive toward dystopia on the one hand and fantasy on the other.

## [Introduction to Digital Media](https://gwijthoff.github.io/digitalmedia/)

Spring 2017 • undergrad lecture • Columbia

> Course begins by examining the historical roots of the concept of “information,” and then proceeds along a “stack” of topics in digital culture: code, interface, device, infrastructure, and power. Each of these concepts is explored through a comparative framework, using hands-on exercises and readings from across the disciplines, including the philosophy of computation, history of technology, cultural studies, science fiction, and media theory. Questions raised by the course are historical (how have media been experienced as “new” at different moments in time?), theoretical (how exactly do we address “medium” as an object of study), and tactical (how can we use our local experience of digital devices as a framework for thinking global networks?).

## [Digital Methods Workshop](https://gist.github.com/gwijthoff/b21eae48a5d2852a60020fd4179e9d2b)

Fall 2016 • graduate workshop • Columbia

> A series of workshops introducing first-year graduate students to the basic computational literacy necessary for research in the humanities today. The curriculum is designed to introduce ideas that will scale with students' field-specific research interests as they progress through their respective PhD programs. Introduced tools like the command line, markup and textual transformations, and collaboration through GitHub.

## [Digital Humanities Praxis](https://github.com/gwijthoff/Praxis/blob/master/praxis_syllabus.md)

Spring 2016 • graduate seminar • City University of New York

> Graduate seminar that introduced students to a variety of digital tools and methods through lectures, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects.  Students were exposed to a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into their academic research and teaching.  In addition, they produced a digital project in collaboration with fellow students.

## [The Science of Fiction: American Naturalism, 1880-1915](https://gwijthoff.github.io/naturalism/)

Spring 2016 • undergrad seminar • Columbia

> An advanced undergraduate seminar exploring how naturalist literature imagined itself as a form of "big data" collection, with stories that catalogued the tiniest details of daily life and showed how these infinitesimal moments were all integrated into part of much larger, aggregate social systems.  Amid the expansion of quantitative methods in social and psychological research, naturalist novelists sought ways to count, measure, categorize, and classify those elements that previously were assumed to lie outside the novel's scope.

## [Screen Reading](https://github.com/gwijthoff/Screenreading/blob/master/screenreading_syllabus.md)

Spring 2014 • undergrad seminar • Columbia

> An advanced undergraduate seminar on the history of reading practices.  With today's movement of readers from page to screen, do we accept that a change in format can affect the ways we read? How do technologies of literacy – scrolling, bookmarking, page, index, tab, bookshelf – become metaphors in the digital age? Seminar coupled with a lab component for experiments in digital textuality.
